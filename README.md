# data1030-project

This repository contains Python code, data, figures, and reports for my DATA 1030 Project at Brown University.

This project is an analysis of the Airbnb data at New York City, and here is the content of the project:

 - Introduction
 - Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Methods
 - Results
 - Outlook
 - References
 - Appendix

This project contains data visualizations of the Airbnb listings at New York City, and it predicts the price of Airbnb listings at New York City using $4$ different models with $5$-fold cross-validation. The best of the $4$ models is selected and further analyzed. There is also a section explaining the weakness of the prediction.

Since Python is the language I choose for data analysis, I used the Python version 3.7.3 with the following packages:

 - `pandas` 0.25.0
 - `numpy` 1.17.1
 - `sklearn` 0.21.3
 - `matplotlib` 3.1.1
 
The raw data is in the `data` file. All tables and plots are in the `figures` file. PDF version of all reports and presentations are in the `reports` file. The final model is in the `results` file. All source code (ipython notebooks) are in the `src` file. There is a `LICENSE` file indicating what you can and cannot do with the code.
